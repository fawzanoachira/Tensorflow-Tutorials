# TensorFlow Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of tutorials for learning and working with TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework.

## Contents

1. Introduction to TensorFlow
2. Basic Neural Networks
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the tutorials)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tensorflow-tutorials.git
```
2. Create a Virtual Envirnoment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install tensorflow to this environment
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
## Usage

Each tutorial is contained in its own directory with a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file.

To run a tutorial:

1. Navigate to the tutorial's directory
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open the .ipynb file in your browser

Alternatively, you can use Google Colab to run these tutorials in the cloud.
